For the past 3 years, I have been contributing to design and front-end development for the Information Technology Superintendent at the [Federal University of São Paulo](https://unifesp.br/), and other entities based there, like [SoU_Ciência](https://souciencia.unifesp.br/). I have worked with tools such as CKAN, Joomla, Wordpress, Wiki.js, and OTRS. I have developed projects using Docker, WSL, Git, Next.js, Jekyll, Typescript, Javascript, PHP, HTML, SASS, and Figma. I have utilized Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Indesign, Adobe Photoshop, and Krita. Additionally, I was responsible for creating an information security awareness campaign that was disseminated on the university's social media channels.

Besides, I do [illustrations and digital paitings](/artwork), one of my passions.
