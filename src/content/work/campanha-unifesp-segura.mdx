The Information Technology Superintendence, through the CSIRT - Information Security Incident Handling and Response Team, needed to disseminate best practices and raise awareness of information security among university equipment users, ensuring their secure use of computers and the internet. The proposal was to create a campaign to be broadcast on the university's social media channels. This campaign was named the 'Unifesp + Secure Campaign.'

My role in this project was to develop all the content for this campaign, create the visual identity, and devise the branding strategy.

Twelve topics were chosen, including email security, password tips, password managers, phishing, among others, for which I gathered tips and basic information.
